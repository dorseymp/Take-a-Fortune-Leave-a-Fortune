# Take-a-Fortune-Leave-a-Fortune

Take a Fortune, Leave a Fortune is a MERN stack application that allows users to create fortunes that save a MongoDB database, as well as get fortunes from the database that were submitted by other users.

## Usage

The application can be viewed at [Take a Fortune, Leave a Fortune](https://takeafortuneleaveafortune.herokuapp.com)

## Next Steps

The loading of the fortune from the database is slow and choppy, so I want to create an svg loading animation and then have the broken fortune cookie and fortune appear smoothly. I'd also like to add transitions between views.
